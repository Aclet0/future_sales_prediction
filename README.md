# future_sales_prediction

In this notebook I write my code link to following kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview

Goal of this competition is to predict number of sales during one month for a specific product in a specific shop

Data we train are data from January 2013 to October 2015

Data can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data
a folder data has to be created to work with my notebook
